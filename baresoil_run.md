# ga-products-workflow for any percentile baresoil cover
This workflow can be used to run for any percentile of bare soil product as per product description of
ARG25-minerals in Dec 2015 drafted by Alexis. It is used to run for whole continent by first creating 
20 odd cell txt files. The script create_50.sh will create files from cells.txt. Then needs to run 
run_baresoil.sh to trigger as many cells as required. The input file cells.txt contains all of 1002
tiles.
